      "content": "Sanskrit consonants (व्यञ्जनानि vyañjanāni) are organized with remarkable scientific precision. Unlike English, Sanskrit systematically arranges consonants in groups called vargas, organized by PLACE OF ARTICULATION (where in the mouth the sound is made) and MANNER OF ARTICULATION (how the sound is produced). Each varga has 5 consonants: (1) voiceless unaspirated, (2) voiceless aspirated, (3) voiced unaspirated, (4) voiced aspirated, and (5) nasal. This lesson introduces the first two vargas: Ka-varga (velars) and Ca-varga (palatals). We teach CLASSICAL pronunciation (~500 BCE-500 CE), NOT modern Indian tradition. Key concept: ASPIRATION is phonemic—it changes word meaning. Aspirated consonants have a strong puff of air.",

Each varga follows the same pattern: (1) voiceless unaspirated, (2) voiceless aspirated, (3) voiced unaspirated, (4) voiced aspirated, (5) nasal. KEY CONCEPTS: ASPIRATION is phonemic—ख is NOT the same as क. VOICING is phonemic—ग is NOT the same as क. This scientific organization reflects the grammatical precision of Sanskrit and was documented by ancient Indian phoneticians (Pāṇini, Prātiśākhyas). Classical pronunciation: no lip rounding for palatals, true palatal articulation (NOT English alveolar 'ch/j'), strong aspiration for kh/gh/ch/jh. There are 3 more vargas (retroflexes, dentals, labials) totaling 33 consonants—you'll learn those next!",

Say each varga in order multiple times. 4) Distinguish between similar pairs: क vs ख (aspiration), क vs ग (voicing), च vs ज (voicing). 5) Practice with example words, ensuring correct classical pronunciation (no lip rounding for च/छ/ज/झ, true palatal articulation). 6) Try combining these consonants with vowels you learned in Lesson 1 (e.g., क + आ = का /kaː/, च + इ = चि /ci/). 7) Important: pronounce the inherent vowel 'a' (/ɐ/) in each consonant unless modified by a mātṛkā.",
