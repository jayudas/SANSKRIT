## 🎯 Key Decisions Made

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend/Backend:** Next.js 14 (full-stack)
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + Prisma
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **State:** Zustand + React Query
- **Monorepo:** Turborepo
- **Deployment:** Local development initially

### Development Approach
- **Incremental:** Build month-by-month
- **Quality-focused:** No time pressure, thorough testing
- **Audio Strategy:** Record/source as we build each module
- **Local-first:** Development on local machine

### Git Workflow
- **Feature branches:** ALWAYS (never commit to main)
- **Push frequently:** After every phase of work
- **Conventional commits:** Using semantic commit messages
- **Testing required:** 6-level testing workflow before every commit

7. GitHub repository created and pushed
8. Documentation completed

### 📋 Next Steps (In Order)

1. **Set Up PostgreSQL Database Locally**
   - Install PostgreSQL (if not already installed)
   - Create database: `createdb sanskrit_learning`

   - Extract Phase 1, Month 1, Week 1 from curriculum
   - Structure vocabulary data

3. **Build Core UI Components**
   - DevanagariText component (with font)
   - Button component
   - Card component
   - Audio player component

4. **Build Lesson Viewer**
   - Lesson page layout
   - Content renderer
   - Navigation
   - Progress tracking integration

5. **Source Audio Files**
   - Find/record vowel sounds (14 files)
   - Find/record consonant sounds (33 files)
   - Organize in `/public/audio/phonemes/`

## 🚀 How to Resume Development

### For Next Session:

1. **Read context:**
   ```bash
   # Read CLAUDE.md for full project context
   # Read SETUP.md for setup instructions
   # Read this file (SESSION_SUMMARY.md) for status
   ```

2. **Set up database:**
   ```bash
   cd packages/database
   # Create .env with DATABASE_URL
   npm run db:generate
   npm run db:push
   ```

3. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. **Create feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # NEVER work on main directly
   ```

5. **Follow workflows:**
   - Testing: 6-level process before every commit
   - Git: Feature branches, push after every phase
   - Documentation: Document as you build

## 💡 Key Reminders

### Quality Philosophy
- ⚠️ **NO TIME PRESSURE** - Quality over speed, always
- ⚠️ **NEVER RUSH** - Take time to do things right
- ⚠️ **TEST EVERYTHING** - 6-level testing is mandatory
- ⚠️ **FIX, DON'T HIDE** - Never skip or disable failing tests

### Git Workflow
- ⚠️ **FEATURE BRANCHES ONLY** - Never commit to main
- ⚠️ **PUSH FREQUENTLY** - After every phase of work
- ⚠️ **VERIFY BEFORE PR** - Check remote has all commits
- ⚠️ **TEST BEFORE COMMIT** - Complete all testing levels

### Frontend Testing
- ⚠️ **USER TESTING REQUIRED** - Frontend must be tested in browser
- ⚠️ **WAIT FOR CONFIRMATION** - Don't commit until user approves
- ⚠️ **NO SHORTCUTS** - Automated tests are not sufficient alone
