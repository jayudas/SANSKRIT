      "content": "This lesson covers THREE complete vargas totaling 15 consonants. This includes two of Sanskrit's most distinctive features: (1) TRUE RETROFLEX consonants (Ṭa-varga), where the tongue curls back to contact the roof of mouth, and (2) TRUE DENTAL consonants (Ta-varga), where the tongue touches the TEETH (not the alveolar ridge like English). The distinction between ट /ʈ/ (retroflex) and त /t̪/ (dental) is CRITICAL—confusing them changes meaning. English has neither true retroflexes nor true dentals. Finally, we cover Pa-varga (labials), which are closer to English but with one key difference: फ is aspirated /pʰ/ (like 'p' + breath), NOT the fricative /f/. Classical pronunciation standard throughout.",

      "content": "The Ṭa-varga consists of 5 RETROFLEX consonants produced by CURLING THE TONGUE TIP BACKWARD to contact the hard palate or post-alveolar region. These are called mūrdhanya (cerebral/retroflex). The tongue tip is bent backward and up. English has NO true retroflex consonants—this is one of Sanskrit's most distinctive phonetic features. Mastering retroflexes is essential, as they contrast with dentals: ḍaṇḍa (staff) vs. danda would be meaningless confusion.",

The most critical concepts: (1) RETROFLEX vs. DENTAL: ट /ʈ/ (tongue curled back) is completely different from त /t̪/ (tongue at teeth). English has NEITHER. Spanish/French 't' is dental; English 't' is alveolar. (2) ASPIRATION matters: क vs. ख, त vs. थ, प vs. फ—these pairs differ ONLY in aspiration, but aspiration is PHONEMIC (changes meaning). (3) फ is /pʰ/ NOT /f/: Your lips close completely and release with breath—NO friction. (4) FIVE places of articulation: velar (back), palatal (mid), retroflex (curled back), dental (teeth), labial (lips). Each has the same 5-consonant pattern. Remaining: 8 consonants (ya, ra, la, va, śa, ṣa, sa, ha)—next lesson!",
