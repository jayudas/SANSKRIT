These include: (1) APPROXIMANTS (antaḥsthāḥ 'between sounds')—semi-vowels that flow more than stops: य र ल व; (2) SIBILANTS (ūṣmāṇaḥ 'heated sounds')—three fricatives that are DISTINCT in classical Sanskrit but often merged in modern pronunciation: श /ɕ/, ष /ʂ/, स /s/; (3) GLOTTAL—ह /ɦ/, a VOICED glottal fricative (unlike voiceless English /h/). The three-way sibilant distinction is CRITICAL for sandhi rules and classical pronunciation. After this lesson, you will have mastered all 33 consonants of the Sanskrit alphabet!",

They are sonorants—the airflow is relatively unobstructed compared to stops. They function as consonants but have vowel-like acoustic properties. These are also called semi-vowels.

(2) FOUR APPROXIMANTS: ya /j/, ra /r/, la /l/, va /ʋ/—semi-vowels, sonorant. (3) THREE SIBILANTS: śa /ɕ/ (palatal), ṣa /ʂ/ (retroflex), sa /s/ (alveolar)—DISTINCT in classical Sanskrit! (4) ONE GLOTTAL: ha /ɦ/ (voiced glottal fricative). CRITICAL TAKEAWAYS: (a) Retroflex vs. dental distinction is fundamental; (b) Aspiration is phonemic throughout; (c) Three-way sibilant distinction crucial for sandhi; (d) Classical pronunciation differs significantly from modern.
